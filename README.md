# Smurfs Chasing Game
 A mini game of Gargamel and his cat chases the player.

 Try to reach to smurfette. Play as either brainy smurf or lazy smurf. They both have different abilities.

 If you get caught, you lose some points, and the catcher returns to their starting point to chase you again. If your score falls below zero, you lose the game. The goal is to collect gold and mushrooms to reach Smurfette with a high score and complete the game.

 From harita.txt you can change the map,smurf to play with or the starting positions.
